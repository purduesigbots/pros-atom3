**Did you find a bug?**
- **Before opening an issue, make sure you are in the right repository!**
  purduesigbots maintains four repositories related to PROS:
  - [purduesigbots/pros](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros): the repository containing the source code for the kernel the user-facing API. Issues should be opened here if they affect the code you write (e.g., "I would like to be able to do X with PROS," or "when I call <PROS function> X doesn't work as I expect")
  - [purduesigbots/pros-cli](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli): the repository containing the source code for the command line interface (CLI). Issues should be opened here if they concern the PROS CLI (e.g., problems with commands like `pros make`), as well as project creation and management.
  - [purduesigbots/pros-atom](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-atom): the repository containing the source code for the Atom package. Issues should be opened here if they concern the coding experience within Atom (e.g., "there is no button to do X," or "the linter is spamming my interface with errors").
  - [purduesigbots/pros-docs](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-docs): the repository containing the source code for [our documentation website](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu). Issues should be opened here if they concern available documentation (e.g., "there is not guide on using <PROS feature>," or "the documentation says to do X, but only Y works")
- **Verify the bug lies in PROS.** We receive quite a few reports that are due to bugs in user code, not the kernel.
- Ensure the bug wasn't already reported by searching GitHub [issues](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/issues)
- If you're unable to find an issue, [open](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/issues/new) a new one.
